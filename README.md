# Category classification using ML

This project documents the process of classifying IT tickets into their respective category using machine learning.

Tickets are sent to IT department requesting help and reporting any technical malfunctions. After the tickets are received by the main system, it is assigned to a department manual by a human worker.

We are trying to automate the process of the tickets being assigned specific department or augment human workers to better classify IT tickets.

The data is obtained through scrapping emails received by technicians after they have been classified by a human. The original tickets only consist
of short description and additional comments.
